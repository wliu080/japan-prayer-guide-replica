Japanese people have gone to Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples for centuries. Many find comfort in repeating the simple rituals of purification and prayer. Faith or belief is not a prerequisite and anyone is welcome to join in. Such religous practices are deeply rooted in what it means to be Japanese.
